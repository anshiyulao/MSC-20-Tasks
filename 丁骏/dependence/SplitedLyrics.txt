got our pickaxe swinging from
side to side
side side to side
this task a grueling one hope to find some diamonds tonight night night

-j=15 cause baby tonight
you grab your pick shovel and bolt again
and run run until it s done done until the sun comes up in the morn
-j=15 cause baby tonight
-j=16 the creeper s tryna steal all our stuff again

overhear some hissing from right behind

shame it s gotta end at this

so fight fight like it s the last last night
